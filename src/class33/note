exception :
exception is unwanted bahavior which occurs at run time and ,make our programs terminate
abruptly
exception handling:
exception handling is a mechanism that allows us to avoid runtime erorrs and helps us
convert complex erorr ,message to something simpler that a normal user can understand

how we implement exception handling in java:
     we hava new keyword and new blocks of code which allow us to handling exception in java
     blocks of code 1)try 2)catch3)finally4)throw5)throws
try block:
      in the try block we write the code which can may throw an exception
 catch block:
       contains the backup code ,the code that we want to exexute in case of failure .it can
       also contain code to simplify the erorr message if can aslo contain teh code which
       might send a notification or an email to th developers or admin in case of failure
 how it work:
          we can multiple catch block with one try block . each handling a different error
          when can also put a last catch block with exception class sso that jif something goes wrong
          and there is no specific catch block to handle it the exception one will hamdle it.


  finally block:
  finally block id always executed on matter what happen in try block or catch block
  we should put cleanup code
